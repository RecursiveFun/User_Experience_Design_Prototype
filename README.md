# User_Experience_Design_Prototype
Prototype site made for part of my project with User Experience Design. Low-fidelity wireframes were created, a user persona, and guerilla testing were conducted prior to the final revisions of the wireframes. I tried keeping the design simple so as not to overcomplicate the project as coding is not the purpose of this project. Attached is the design process that this prototype has gone through.
